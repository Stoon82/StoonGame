# 🎮 StoonGame Project Roadmap

## 🌟 Currently Implemented Features

### 🌐 World Generation & Rendering
- ✅ Triangle-based grid system with axial coordinates
- ✅ Dynamic grid sizing (1-20 dimensions)
- ✅ 60-degree arc placement at triangle corners
- ✅ Four ground types (GRASS, WATER, SAND, ROCK)
- ✅ Material caching for performance
- ✅ Camera auto-adjustment based on grid size
- ✅ Random ground type assignment
- ✅ Precise triangle vertex positioning
- ✅ Connecting arcs between triangles

### 🎨 Visual Features
- ✅ Ground type coloration:
  - GRASS: Light green (0x90EE90)
  - WATER: Royal blue (0x4169E1)
  - SAND: Sandy brown (0xF4A460)
  - ROCK: Gray (0x808080)
- ✅ Alternating upward/downward triangle orientation
- ✅ Z-fighting prevention with slight elevation differences

### 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure
- ✅ Three.js integration for 3D rendering
- ✅ Webpack build system
- ✅ Development server setup
- ✅ Modular code architecture
